<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

<p>Your exemption is now valid and you can let your property. It will appear on the [exemption register](link to https://prsregister.beis.gov.uk/NdsBeisUi/register-search-exemptions) 
within 24 hours. If all your evidence was correctly uploaded, the exemption is valid for:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 months if you're a new landlord</li>
<li>5 years for all other exemptions</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Review of your exemption</h2>

<p>Your exemption has been sent to the local authority for review. The local authority may review your exemption at any time within the first 12 months. 
If the evidence required was not uploaded during your registration, they can revoke the exemption. Your local authority will contact you to explain what steps will 
need to be taken. This may include issuing compliance notices.</p>
